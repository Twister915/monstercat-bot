Monstercat Bot
==============

The [/r/Monstercat](http://www.reddit.com/r/Monstercat) subreddit has faced a
pretty much continual problem whereby we get clogged up every day there is a
Monstercat release with links to the track on every site Monstercat releases on.
To solve it, I wrote this reddit bot, which visits each site (where we can), and
creates a reddit thread with links to each of the release sites.

If you find a bug, or want to add something, please do. I haven't commented the
code enough so it'll be a little hard to, but it's generally pretty organised,
I didn't go for the whole nested callbacks path or anything crazy like that.
